Thanks for stopping by! I am Alexandra, a tech
enthusiast, but Addi's mom first!! I enjoy learning about the latest software and
tools, and then helping others to do the same. I have worked on tech projects as
a business analyst, developer in test, and technical support engineer, but I currently
specialize in Reliability Engineering in the Cloud space. It's definitely a space that
allows you to cover a lot of tech ground.

I am a New Yorker at heart, who currently resides in North Carolina with my
daughter. I currently work at a midsized company based in Palo Alto, CA...and enjoy
it very much!

I am passionate about open source and cloud, and have recently found my voice in the DEI
space within the tech field. We shall see how this plays out. I originally started a site
to practice on Kubernetes and encourage my self to read and blog some. As you can imagine,
life will catch up with you. However, I have decided to pick this back up and continue to
utilize it technical projects and just for fun. Maybe it will help me get back to reading
as well. Anywho, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for
assistance.
